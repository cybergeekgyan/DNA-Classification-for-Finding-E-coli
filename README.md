# DNA Classification for Finding E-Coli

DNA promoter classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to understand if a person is having E-Coli virus or not

We will be working with the DNA Dataset which holds the information about a small part from the DNA encoded into four types of DNA molecule that are

- A--> (Adenine),
- T--> (Thymine),
- G--> (Guanine), and
- C--> (Cytosine)

- We will preprocess the data into a more usable format and train out MLP classifier model.

- This model is based on Neural Network Architecture which provides very high performance with less training time.

- Then we will be creating a Django-project which will be our website base that will be hosted on Amazon Web Services(AWS)


MLP Classifier stands for Multi-Level Perceptron Classifier
